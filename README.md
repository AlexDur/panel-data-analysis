# panel_data_analysis

Maybe this script can help someone to overcome the pitfalls of a panel data model analysis in R in his/her work.


Providing the R script which I wrote to conduct a panel data analysis in my thesis. The thesis was about empirircally analyzing the link between migration and food security.

I applied three models - pooling, fixed effects and random model - on a panel data set (10-year-period, 23 countries, 10 variables) to see which of those best explains the variation in the dependent variable (number of first-time asylum applicants)

An automatic variable selection determined which of these models was to be considered most efficient concerning the estimation.
